    "Constrain form width:",
    "  * Mobile: form maxWidth 360–420px",
    "  * Tablet: form maxWidth 500–600px",
    "  * Desktop: form maxWidth 500–600px (forms should not be too wide)",
    "  * Input width = form width (inputs fill the form container)",
    "Vertical rhythm (spacing between elements):",
    "  * Label → input gap: 8px",
    "  * Between form fields: 16–20px",
    "  * Fields → actions (buttons): 24–32px",

    "  * Title/heading at the top (larger fontSize, more margin-bottom)",
    "  * Field group container with consistent spacing",
    "  * Each field: label above input container",
    "  * Actions container at the bottom (separated from fields)",
    "Inputs must:",

    "  * Be visually connected to their labels (label directly above)",
    "  * Appear as input fields with border, not loose elements",
    "  * Be grouped logically (all inputs in one container)",
    "Buttons must:",
    "  * Be in a separate \"actions\" container, NOT inside input-group",
    "  * Have full-width on mobile (width = form width)",
    "  * Be clearly identifiable as primary actions",
    "  * Align with the form width",
    "  * Have clear visual separation from form fields (24–32px gap)",
    "Titles/Headings:",
    "  * Use larger fontSize (20–24px for main title, 16–18px for section titles)",
    "  * Have larger margin-bottom (24–32px)",
    "  * Visually \"anchor\" the screen",
    "  * Use primary text color \"#111111\"",
    "Form screens MUST use centered layout with constrained width as specified above",
    "Form screens: label→input gap 8px, between fields 16–20px, fields→actions 24–32px",
    "Form screens: buttons MUST be in separate actions container, full-width on mobile, separated from fields by 24–32px",
    "Do NOT put buttons inside input-group containers (buttons are separate actions)",
    "Do NOT make forms too wide (constrain to 360–420px on mobile, 500–600px on tablet/desktop)"
