  "description": "General generation principles that ALWAYS apply",
  "rules": [
    "You are generating DesignSpecs for real application UIs, not raw layout primitives.",
    "Your goal is to produce layouts that resemble production-ready application screens at a wireframe+ level.",
    "Generated designs must look like real apps, not like ungrouped containers with text.",
    "Every screen must have a single root container (frame)",
    "Content must be vertically structured with clear spacing",
    "ALWAYS specify explicit width AND height for the root frame",
    "Inputs are NOT plain text",
    "Represent each input as: a container (frame) with padding, a label text above or inside, placeholder text inside the container (e.g., \"Enter your email\", \"Enter password\", \"Enter value\")",
    "CRITICAL: NEVER generate text nodes with empty content",
    "If an input field is required, ALWAYS include placeholder text",
    "Text nodes representing input placeholders must have meaningful content",
    "Use consistent vertical spacing between elements",
    "Minimum spacing between form fields: 12–16px",
    "Padding inside containers: at least 16–24px",
    "Buttons must be visually distinguishable",
    "Represent buttons as a container with background and label",
    "Buttons must have padding and clear size",
    "Default button style: background \"#2563EB\", textColor \"#FFFFFF\", borderRadius 8",
    "Titles are NOT ordinary text nodes",
    "Main screen title: fontSize: 20–24px (larger than body text), margin-bottom: 24–32px (more spacing), color: \"#111111\" (primary text color), Visually \"anchor\" the screen",
    "Section titles: fontSize: 16–18px, margin-bottom: 16–20px",
    "Titles should be at the top of their container",
    "Use explicit spacing (gap/padding) to separate titles from content",
    "NEVER create text nodes with empty content (empty string \"\")",
    "All text nodes MUST have non-empty content",
    "Input fields MUST include placeholder text (e.g., \"Enter your email\", \"Enter password\")",
    "Labels MUST have descriptive text",
    "Do NOT add decorative elements",
    "Do NOT invent brand colors (use defaults unless user specifies)",
    "Do NOT overdesign",
    "The result should feel like a clean, neutral SaaS or mobile app",
    "Generate explicit values in the DesignSpec so the executor does not need to infer layout decisions",
    "Do NOT place raw text elements directly on the canvas without layout",
    "Do NOT create isolated elements without visual grouping",
    "Do NOT assume \"designer intuition\" — be explicit in structure",
    "Do NOT generate empty text content under any circumstances",
    "Do NOT leave root frame height undefined",
    "Container styling rules:",
    "  * Layout containers (for grouping, spacing, centering) MUST NOT have background, borderRadius, or border properties",
    "  * Only card-like containers, input containers, and buttons should have visual styling",
    "  * A container that exists purely for layout should be transparent and unstyled"
